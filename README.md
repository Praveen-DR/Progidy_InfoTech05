The provided keylogger 

This program in Python uses the `pynput` library to capture and log keystrokes. The program specifies a log file named `key_log.txt` where all keystrokes are recorded. It defines two functions: `on_press` and `on_release`. The `on_press` function captures each key press, writing the character to the log file if it is a regular key, or writing the key name for special keys (e.g., space, enter). The `on_release` function checks if the escape key is released, and if so, it stops the key listener. The program sets up a `keyboard.Listener` to call these functions whenever a key is pressed or released, and the listener runs in the foreground until the escape key is pressed. This implementation explains how to capture keyboard events and save them to a file, emphasizing the importance of ethical considerations and permissions when using keyloggers.
